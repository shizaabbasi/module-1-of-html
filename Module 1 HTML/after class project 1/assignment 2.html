    <p>Hi my name is <h3>Shiza Abbasi.</h3> And have been assigned by the project to create a <b>school webpage</b><br>I study in <h1><center>Fazaia Education System School</center></h1><br><font color=blue>It's located in E-9 Islamabad.</font><i>It's an airforce school</i>
    We have 2 buildings in it one for <mark>Junior section </mark> and the other for <mark> Senior section</mark> <font color=dark pink>The junior section has sclasses from nursery to grade 4.<br> And the senior section has it from grade 5 to grade 12.</font><br><small>We have a big ground for sports and we even have a sports week anually</small> 
    In our school we have a<q>library,canteen,auditorium,music room and art room as well</q><blockquote><font color=purple>I have completed my matric from the same school and now Iam currently studying in grade 11.</font></blockquote>The teacher's are amazing and very friendly.Our school is registered with the Federal board.
    I have alot of friends at school and they are very cooperative as well.  We have many functions at the school like<q><font color=green>Welcome party,Farewell party,Defence day function,Independence day function,Eid Milad-un-Nabi and many more. </font></q>
    In addition to that we have <q><font color=apple>maths quiz, english and urdu writing contests, and much more.</font></q><br> in the inter we have 3 sections <q>Pre-Medical, Pre-Engineering and ICS</q> out of which i have chosen <b>ICS</b> because I want to be a cybercrime officer or just any officer in the crime branch. Iam also pretty interested in programming so maybe I could also go in the direction of becoming a Programmer.
